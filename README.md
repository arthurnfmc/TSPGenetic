# TSP with Genetic Algorithms

This repository contains the code and resources related to the project developed for the [Evolutionary Computation (BCC461) course at Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP)](http://www3.decom.ufop.br/decom/disciplina_ementa/bcc461/). The project aims to explore Evolutionary Algorithms in the context of the [Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). 

# Technologies

This project was conducted using Python 3.11 on Google Colab and the following frameworks/libraries:

- DEAP
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

# Data

Experimental data can be found at [TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/index.html).
